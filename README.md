#Mini Movie Seat Selection Application

##This is a mini movie seat selection application built with the sole purpose of learning more about three types of languages:
  1. JavaScript (Vanilla)
  2. HTML
  3. CSS
##Full disclosure is that it was built with coaching and lessons involved and is not entirely my own work. While I do understand and can explain every line of code, and I did make a few tweaks to learn more about what was going on with different code related aspects, I do not claim this to be entirely original.
